## Talks

### Invasive Alien Species

Nicolas Pardon (ANB)

This is an introductory talk about Invasive Alien Species (IAS) and its legislative regulation.

By people introduced (vrijwillig of toevallig) after 1500.

De regel van 3x10 van Williamson, 1996: vanuit introductie tot establishment 

Legislation: EU verordening 1143/2014 (22 October 2014) about prevention and sensibilization and management of the introduction and sprad of IAS

Soortenbesluit Hoofdstuk 4/1 + ijlage 3/1 (management)

In Belgium: samenwerkingsakkoord van 30 jan 2019 between federal and regional actors.

EU legislation says that you may not:
- hold them 
- kweken
vervoerd
- in de handel worden gebracht

The species list is typically referred as the **Union list**.

Which are the problems due to IAS?
More and more described by PAP and IPBES and more picked up by media (television, newspapers) due to their impact on economy, biodiversity and human health

Which are the priorities and responsabilties? They are decided by the Flemish governement.





### Het PRIUS-rapport

Subtitle: Een kader voor de aanpak van invasieve uitheemse soorten in Vlaanderen. Een prioritering voor natuurbeleid. 

Bram D'Hondt (INBO) and Nicolas Pardon (ANB)

The rapport is published as open access: https://doi.org/10.21436/inbor.88096226
The talk is prerecorded and available online: 


Responsabilities (uitvoering):
- De vervuiler
- Elke terreinverantwoordelijke

Not always easy to apply.

Sometimes it's better that external instances (e.g. Flemish authority) take care about the IAS management:
- rapid response
- management niet technically achievable by the area manager
- the management goals cannot be achieved by area manager


Which species are relevant in Flanders?

Steps: 
1. check species based on policy relevant criteria, or _filters_
2. Integration of all these criteria

Criteria:
- marine (federal competency) vs non-marine (Flemish bevoegdheid): marine species are not taken into account
- risk to establish: complex process (especially for plants, but we can ). Approximation: climate niche study, zone "Cfb " and "Cfa"
- impact type: based on risk judgement studies applied to Flemish situation
- at which extent are these IAS in Flanders already? E.g. sporadic, traces, not yet seen. A way to assess this is to calculate the observed occupancy (number of 1x1km grid cells)
- % occupied cells that fall in Natura2000 areas, i.e. **specifity**
- % occupied cells of NAtura2000 areas, i.e. **sensitivity**. Sensitivity and specifity can then be plotted in a x(specifity) y (sensitivity) plot
- emerging or trend indicators based on TrIAS: assessing if a species is emerging (based on nubmer of occurrences and nubmer of cells in Belgium/Natura2000)
- international resposnability: which species are/could invade other regions or countries due to their presence in Flanders?
- management feasibility: this is the most difficult criterium as it is very sensitive, data intensive and qualitative criterium. 


Each criteria has a different weight depending on the stadium of invasion class (absent, spradaci, established, invasive).

At last, species are grouped:
- IRR: irrelevant
- REL-AFW: relative absent species: early response
- REL-AAN-SPO: no good candidates for tatl manamgent (too much unkonwn factors), well for partial management (e.g. by building barriers for further spread)
- REL-AAN-GEV-BEP: the besta candidate for total management
- REL-AAN-GEV-VER-BUI: they are less manageable for natuurbeleidskern, but they can be interesting to manage for other reasons
- REL-AAN-GEV-VER-NAT

Fiches are made for each species/group.

Improvements: 
- further prioritization within groeps
- hertoetsing needed if we have better data, better methods, voortschrijdende uitbreiding en inzicht


Notice that PrIUS is based on already existing data and workflows. And it synthesizes key statistics for natural policy.

Nicolas Pardon takes the floor to speak about some practice aspects such as management responsability aspects.
ANB does:
- coordination alien species policy
- coordination alien species management
- manages IAS on their areas themselves
