### Reprocudible and Reusable Remote Sensing Workflows

Authors: **Edzer Pebesma**, Anna Anghelea

[Abstract](https://pretalx.earthmonitor.org/gw2023/talk/VDFCUV/)

Reproducible remote sensing papers: Edzer is trying to launch a new open access and free (no publicatoin fee) journal about remote sensing.

What's _easy_ to do?
- Package versioning
- System requirements versioning, 
- Operating system (Virtual Machine or container)

On the other hand, what's _difficult_ to do?
- Run workflows on large datasets. Possible solution: share smaller datasets and argue why that is sufficient
- Using [Google Eearth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), arcGIS, [ERDAS](https://hexagon.com/products/erdas-imagine), but also HPC dedicate models: to what extent are such workflows reproducbile? Are we still doing open science then?
- Get someone to review your code and give feedback:
	- journals have no review requirements, neither for authores nor for reviewers
	- [Code check](codecheck.org.uk): would you like to run my code, review it and give me feedback? It's a nice initiative: Independent execution of computations underlying research articles. You can add a badge on GItHub in green if somebody run successfully your code.
	- When submitting a manuscript, report on successult reproduction / code review


a key motivation behind openEO was the ability to compare cloud based platforms with each other (tech validation)
What's hard: how do we describe, store, advertise, share, and find [openEO process graphs](https://api.openeo.org/v/0.3.0/processgraphs/)? The json file you get it's quite difficult to read/understand. 
Should we share process graphs or rather Jupyter / R-markdown / Quarto notebooks? These are easier to read and can be a mix of text and code.

ESA initiatives:
	-launching the Open Science persistent demonstrator co-sponsored with NASA and implemented by [OGC](https://www.ogc.org/) to build interoperability across platforms and demonostrate reporducilibity of workflows
	- promoting the process graph to promote reproducibility
	- coordination of several communities working on related technologies including geo-datacubes and datacube APIs to facilitate reproducibility
	- expanding and advancing the Deep Earth System Data Lab [Deep ESDL](https://www.earthsystemdatalab.net/) that is based fully on open source technology
	- new activity called earth-code ([general link](https://eo4society.esa.int/2023/06/27/invitation-to-tender-earth-code-earth-science-collaborative-open-development-environment/) info, [details]( https://esastar-publication-ext.sso.esa.int/ESATenderActions/details/61267)) starting in November 2023 will have dedicated work stream: e.g. by "how to discover and execute workflows?" "How to maintain a healthy community that practices open Earth System science", "how to persistently store science data AND code AND documentation from Earth Science projects following FAIR principles?"

Idea of Pebesma: make the reproducibility work a publication on its own.

To reproduce things, containerization and software distribution is absolutely needed: new initiative mentioned from audience: [geonix](https://github.com/imincik/geonix), A cross-platform geospatial software distribution and development environment.

### Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem: Immediately Available Data and Associated Services

Author: Jędrzej Bojanowski

[Abstract](https://pretalx.earthmonitor.org/gw2023/talk/ELM7EN/)

Unfortunately I could not follow it: I was in another parallel session. 

Some **key points** from the abstract: 
- Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) represents a key milestone in access to Copernicus satellite data. 
- CDSE exposes data of other satellites as well, e.g. Landsat, SMOS and Envisat
- CDSE will offer access to commercial satellite data

The user does not have to order and wait for the data anymore.

Direct access also allows bulk data processing and streaming, e.g. via OGC services (WMS/WFS)

Another novelty of CDSE are the various interfaces where the data are available:
- old-fashioned download
- [OData](https://www.odata.org/), an ESA-adopted standard, based on RESTful API
- [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://stacspec.org/en/about/), STAC and STAC API that become a standard in the EO community and being onboarded to OGC
- Jupyter Hub, very suitable tool for prototyping, developing, and testing applications open-source, online, interactive web application which gives access to computational environments and resources without burdening the users with installation and maintenance tasks

The vast majority of the described capabilities are available free-of-charge for the individual's use.

### European platforms to support the Green Deal

Authors: **Benjamin Schumacher** (EODC), Christian Briese

[Abstract](https://pretalx.earthmonitor.org/gw2023/talk/LXPPYZ/).


[EODC](https://eodc.eu/): located in Vienna. Active in the C-GLOPS (Copernicus - global land), C3S2 (Copernicus Climate Change Service), Lot 4 (land hydrology and cryosphere) and Global Flood Monitoring Service (fast analysis and predictions for use of public authorities)

EODC is composed of:
- cloud
- storage
- backup
- HPC

EO platforms show: 
- fragmentation, redundancy and lacking coordination among each other
- prevalence of old Virtual Machine

Idea: [openEO API](https://api.openeo.org/), which was part of the [openEO Platform](openeo.cloud), is a combination of several backends creating a federation of data accesses via the [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://stacspec.org/en/about/), STAC.

The end user consults the federated catalogue STAC and behind the screen STAC will do for you the data request to the right data provider such as [cesnet](https://www.cesnet.cz/e-infrastruktura-3/data-storage/?lang=en), [terra scope](https://terrascope.be/en), [eodc](https://eodc.eu/about-us/), [SINERGISE](https://www.sinergise.com/)

KEY MESSAGE: federation of data catalogue.

But the most important is a community that builds a framework for FAIR scientific computing upon data access.

storage nodes -> NPC / Cloud Compute (the compute nodes) -> Jupyter notebooks (users)

[C-SCALE](https://c-scale.eu/) project helps to reach a federation of data catalogs. Notice that C-SCALE will be integrated with the [European Open Science Cloud](https://eosc-portal.eu/) (EOSC) so that C-SCALE solutions can be seamlessly integrated in all the other EOSC-supported research and innovation processes and practices.

C-SCALE mission is clear: C-SCALE  will enhance EOSC Portal with pan-European federated data and computing infrastructure services for Copernicus.

What's the green deal data space: a federation of data ecosystems to jointly tackle climate change
The European Commision laws concerning the green deal data space:
- Single Market for data: [COM/2020/66](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0066)
- Tackling climate and environmental: [COM/2019/640](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2019%3A640%3AFIN)

So, this is the road to follow:
- Abstracting complexity by federated data catalogue
- Provide transparency by open science (and FAIR I would add) principles
- Pixel to contintental scalability by scalable buliding block processes

The most important observation from the Q&A: the federation of data is not really a problem, we will implement it with STAC. The **challenge** is **federating** the analysis **code**: implicitly it means that all partners will support openEO standards and its versions.

### DestinE's Core Service Platform

Author: Inés Sanz Morère

[Abstract](https://pretalx.earthmonitor.org/gw2023/talk/TE7TSF/)

- [Destination Earth](https://destination-earth.eu/) (DestinE) intiative
- [Destination Earth services platform](https://destination-earth.eu/destination-earth/destines-components/destination-earth-service-platform/) (DESP)

**Goal**: DestinE develops highly accurate digital model of the Earth to assist users to monitor, simulate and predict the effect of adopted strategies and mitigation measures

**Objectives**: contribute to policy makers, researchers (provide access to data, allow modelling including Machine Learning) and general public (raising awareness)

We are in Phase 1 (2022-2024): progressive entering into operation of routine services. The DESOP Advanced services are planned to be ready in Dec 2023.

System implementation

Users interface the COre Service Platform of ESA wich is connected to the Digital Twin Engine of the [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts](https://www.ecmwf.int/) (ECMWF) and the Data Lake of EUMETSAT

Notice that it is one system developed by the 3 entities.

DestinE's Core Service PLatform (DESP) is the user access point to DestinE system.

DESP is a comprehensive framework for the data analysis and management. It enables the development and exploitation of applications and services targeting DestinE data. Direct access to users is provided.

[serco](https://www.serco.com/) is the main contractor together with other software companies such as [aliaspace](https://www.alia-space.com/), [CGI](https://www.cgi.com/en) [ThalesAleniaSpace](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en), deimos [OVHcloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/)

Idea is to get validation for gradual opening in December 2023.

DESP Services aims to provide an open and inclusive access to DESP users.

Upcoming events:
- webinars
- [Second Destination Earth User eXchange](https://www.eumetsat.int/2nd-destination-earth-user-exchange) in Bonn (Germany) on Nov 13-14, 2023
- [BiDS BIG DATA FROM SPACE 2023](https://bigdatafromspace2023.org/) in Vienna (Austria), on Nov 6-9, 2023

Available datasets? Still to be defined.

Q&A: There are already two open ecosystems: how this extra one will work with the others? There will be collaboration as ESA is involved in the development.
