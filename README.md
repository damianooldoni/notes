# notes

This repository is a collection of **personal** notes from conferences and workshops I attended. :memo:

## Why?

I was tired of writing notes on the sheets provided by the hosting institution and then never reading them anymore until they were lost, damaged or simply thrown away as a burden in my laptop bag. This website hopes to structure and help the future-me to get the most ouf of all the info I collect during joining such events.

**Disclaimer**: these notes are not intended to be exausthive, fully comprehensive. They do NOT aim to reflect the view of the event organizers and speakers.
