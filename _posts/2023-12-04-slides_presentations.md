## General

- [Website]()
- Organizer: Dirk Maes and Petra Vijncke (INBO)
- Host: INBO
- Date: 04/12/2023
- [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vk_sOgpG_STptnIHcxv2oA8Dav_yIoE7/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=109004011205942623101&rtpof=true&sd=true) (access restricted)


Why? 

- Efficient way to knowledge transfer
- Network
- Papers of presentations are more often cited than others

Poster or presentation?

Poster: 

- More complex message
- Less time limits
- Less informal
- Limited public
- More personal
- If your neighbour doesn't understand anything of it


Presentation:

- Short, simple message
- Limited time (max 20 mins)
- Bigger audience
- Bigger impact
- If you want to explain something to your neighbour


## Posters


What is a poster?

- An A0 piece of paper
- Clear summary of your research
- Reading time: max 5 mins
- Readibility from ~ 2, 3 meters
- Good to understand without guidelines
- Organized, typically in columns with enough white space between sections
- Only essential information
- Target audience
- Follow often IMRaD (nut not always)
- Short, bullet points, no full sentences


Layout posters

- Unique but serious on the same time
- Most important stuff at eye height
- Better landscape than portrait
- PowerPoint, LaTex, Cs3, Inkscape, ...
- Reading direction 
- Add white space: it creates calm
- Use sans-serif font types: e.g. Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Ca
- black text on white

## Presentations

Preparation even before you start making your slides:

- Environmental factors
- Content and technical preparation
- Presentation in yor hand? No, not too big 
- Recorded and online shared?
- Public
- Facility

Knowledge of your target audience is the key factor for preparing your presentation.

Knowledge of the room is essential. Be on time. Ask to test your presentation.

Preparing a presentation takes time.

Do I make hands-out? Yes you can, but not read them: boring. And should I share them on screen? No, otherwise people start to read them and not follow you.

Choice stress: Google Slides, Powerpoint, Prezi, Keynote, ...?

Typically MS Powerpoint is the best choice. Put it on GDrive then. In this way you are sure layout doesn't change when downloading it: this can happen while making Google Slides.

Prezi: graphically very nice, but it can be too much "show" and it risks to be very chaotic.

Content:

- **core message**: each presentation has **one, only one** core message
- Begin with a ice breaker: your stress level decreases and the audience gets an attention boost
- You know typically much more than everybody else in the room: so, do not overstress!
- Varied, inspiring and funny enough


**Preparation is everything.**

Core message:

- dependent on the target audience. The listener plays the main role. Who is the listener?

Remain to the core message, each slide! Ask to yourself: is this slide important for bringing the core message?

**Structure**: clear scenario!

The typical "Greek tragedy" structure:

- context (intro)
- midden: hypothesis, methods, etc.
- conclusion

Use a strong, attractive title.

**How to build your presentation**: take a blanco sheet and make a **mindmap**. In this ways you discover the clusters in your tale and define the best structure to explain the key message.

Structure makes the difference between success or failure. Pay attention to:

- Logical flow
- Easy to remember
- Listener must understand where you are in the structure
- Repeat the head content sentences (with figures or small titles)

Ice breaker: it can be a question, an enigma, a meme, a citation, a picture. A question to your public is a great way to break the ice.

Not done habits of a presenter:

- Read from a A4 paper
- Watch the slides only instead of the public

Exercise by giving a presentation with photo only and without text.

Body language:

- Presenter position in the room: find contact with public if it's possible. Do not sit. Use a pointer. The pointer is also a good tool to have a good hands posture.
- Eye contact. Watch your public: ont only a person of course. Scan the entire audience.
- Read the body language of your audience: the best feedback.
- Do not stay in the shadow/dark zone of the room.


Layout:

- Use contrast 
- Use 24 <= font size <= 44
- Same fonttypes as posters
- Chosen backgrounds must not be distracting

Content:

- A image is more worth than 1000 words
- Short video can work even better, but check that it works and not exagerate
- Use "telegram style"
- One bullet point per slide: the audience cannot read further and so follows you = higher attention level
- Check spelling,: capitalize sentences, spelling mistakes, ...
- graphs cannot describe themselves: you need to do it! Do it clearly
- Do not put unreadable graphs, tables or diagrams
- Pie charts are not done in scientific papers, BUT they are perfectly accetable in presentations. They can be the best choice even!


Talk:

- Use presentation modus
- Timing: it depends on the content of the slides. Typically 1 minute - 2 minutes
- Use a clock
- Ask a signal from the chair man
- Plan and exercise: take into account a buffer period (unexpected events or you get slower than expected)
