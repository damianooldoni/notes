## General 

- [Program](https://earthmonitor.org/events/open-earth-monitor-science-webinar-february-1st-2024/)
- Organiser: Open-Earth Monitor Project
- Host: online via Zoom
- Founder: European Commision via Horizon-Europe, [grant agreement No. 101059548](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101059548)
- Date 01/02/2024

Both talks are focussing on research ongoing at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis ([IIASA](https://iiasa.ac.at/)).


## Exploring In-Situ Data: Definitions, Sources, and Training Applications

Presenter: [Steffen Fritz](https://iiasa.ac.at/staff/steffen-fritz)

In-situ data are very important for completing and testing EO satellite data and the software built on such data.

Some interesting links to in-situ data:
- [GEO-TREES](https://data.geo-trees.org/)
- [CORDA](https://corda.eea.europa.eu/SitePages/About.aspx) (Copernicus Reference Access Data) (you need to [log in](https://corda.eea.europa.eu/_layouts/15/CustomLoginPageFBA/C- ustomLogin.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f_layouts%2f15%2fAuthenticate.aspx%3fSource%3d%252Fsitepages%252Fhome%252Easpx&Source=%2Fsitepages%2Fhome%2Easpx))

[Geo-Wiki](https://www.geo-wiki.org/apps) toolbox is a collection of desktop/mobile applications
FotoQuest Go: mobile app for citizen scientists to report land use and land cover. Possibility to earn (a little of) money during the campaigns (2015 and 2018).
CropObserve: crop type, phenological stage, damage, management activities; all data is open
Picture Pile: Rapid image assessment. For example, do you see deforestation in the picture, 
Crowd2Train Project: Rapid image assessment again, but more about labelling.


## Crowdsourcing land cover and land use reference data using the Geo-Wiki application

Presenter: [Linda See](https://iiasa.ac.at/staff/linda-see)

What is the importance of in-situ data? Providing a ground truth for land cover maps. Examples: there are huge disagreements among land cover maps created by software applied to satellite data. And so, the idea of Geo-Wiki was born. The importance of this disagreement analysis is to get the places where in-situ data collection is  important. Early campaigns were designed to collect data to solve some questions like "can we validate a map of land availability for biomass and adjust the global estimate?"". This campaign (2011-2012) added 33k data points above the 20k used by the original land cover map.

This talk is strongly based on a letter published as open access: [Lessons learned in developing reference data sets with the contribution of citizens: the Geo-Wiki experience](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac6ad7/meta).

To motivate people there were prizes, e.g. authorship in papers, Amazon vouchers. These were thought to motivate people to join for long periods like 6 months.

Examples: 
- Global Cropland Mapping, data in doi.PANGAEA.de 873912, 80 participants
- GLobal Field Size Campaign, 130 participants, 4 week,s 390 K obs, 110k unique locations validated at least 5 times each, pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint.15526
- Human Impact on Forests Campaigns, 130 participants, 7 weeks for 4 campaigns, 459k obs, 110k unique locations validated at least 5 times each. More info here: Lesiv et al. 2022, citizen scientist co-authors, in Scientific Data
- GLobal Built-up Surface Campaign: 61 participants, 7 days, 276k obs, 50k unique locations validated at least 5 times each. Data published in IIASA-PURE repository: dare.iiasa.ac.at/112/. Paper published in Scientific Data. 
- Drivers of Tropical Forest Loss: 58 participants, 2 weeks, 400k obs, 120k unique locations validated at least 3 times each. Data published in IIASA-PURE repo: pure.iiasa.

Additional Tools in Geo-Wiki:
- links to Google Earth
Links to Google Earth Engine applications
- NDVI time series tool
- Links to Sentinel Hun and display of imagery time series from Sentinel-2 and Landsat: it helps by giving context
- Feedback tool
- Branches for quality checking of visual interpretation
- Ability to create your own validation sample migrated to [LACO-Wiki](https://www.laco-wiki.net/en/Welcome)

Ongoing work:
- Validation of changes in CORINE (LAMASUS project)
- Drivers of forest/biomass change (EYE-CLIMA project)
- Updates to forest management map
- New version of Geo-Wiki
